# Lab Notes 📝  

Notes from experiments, tests & setups.  
Sometimes things break, sometimes they work – either way, I learn something.  

## 🔬 Possible topics
- Cluster setups & troubleshooting  
- CI/CD experiments  
- Random scripts & automation ideas  
- Anything worth remembering  

## 💡 Goal
Keep track of what I try out, so I don’t have to reinvent the wheel later.
